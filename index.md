### Highlights 

[Spotlight](https://devpost.com/software/spotlight-6f8ct0)
<br>
I built a system to track people in 3d space and adjust lighting in a room to save energy. We ended up winning 3rd place at HackHarvard 2021

### Other Projects!

[PARIS -- Northeastern University's Submission for the DOE E-Robot Challenge](https://coe.northeastern.edu/news/nu-team-paris-wins-in-phase-1-of-american-made-e-robot-prize/)
<br>
I'm part of a team to build a robot to seal insulation in old buildings and prevent heat leakage. I worked on miscellaneous tasks (mostly software and electrical oriented)

### FIRST Robotics
I founded and led a team in high school for 3 years to design, build, program and iterate 150lb robots to complete a series of challenges in 6 weeks at the beginning of each year. These challenges ranged from placing circular disks precisely on walls to launching balls into a goal 8ft high from 20 feet away. I led the team to the world championships our rookie year, winning over 6 awards throughout my time as Captain. I also worked on a few miscellaneous CAD projects for various challenges. Here are some of the robots I designed & built!
